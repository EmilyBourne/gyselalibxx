# TODO & co.

## Questions
* how should boundary conditions be handled

    guess)

## TODO
* add info about sliced out dimensions to Block
* add easy classes to hold set of values (coords typically)
* make moving from 1-elem array to scalar easy for coords & co.
* make applying member func on array easy for coords & co.
